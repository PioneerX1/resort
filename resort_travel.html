    <h1>Travel Arrangements For Your Stay</h1>
    <h2>By Plane</h2>
    <p>Most major airlines like Alaska, Southwest, Delta, and Hawaiian arrive in the local airport. There is a shuttle from the resort to the airport that departs every 20 minutes.</p>
    <h2>By Boat</h2>
    <p>I don't man, just get off at the dock and start walking. Try and find us. I guess it just depends where the skipper lets you off. Good luck.</p>
    <h2>Low Tide Walk</h2>
    <p>Feeling adventurous? Walk during low-tide from nearby island of Kippuhonae. Just don't take too long, or the water will rise and sharks will get you - this time NO cage!</p>
